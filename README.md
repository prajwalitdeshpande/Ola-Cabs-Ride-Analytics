# 🚕 Ola-Cabs-Ride-Analytics

This project presents a detailed analysis of OLA Cabs booking data using Power BI, SQL, and Excel — with AI-assisted support during development. It explores ride behavior, cancellations, vehicle performance, customer satisfaction, and payment trends using interactive visuals and SQL-powered KPIs.

## 📁 Project Files

- 📊 **Power BI File**: `Ola Cabs B.pbix`  
- 🧮 **SQL Script**: `OLA.sql` (with 10 analytical views)  
- 📄 **Excel Data**: `OLA Cab.xlsx` (1 lakh+ rows, 60+ columns)

---

## 🔍 Key Highlights

- Analyzed over **95,000+ ride bookings** from different pickup/drop locations using filters like booking status, payment method, and ride type.
- Designed **10+ SQL views** to compute key business metrics such as:
  - Ride success rate
  - Average distance per vehicle type
  - Customer satisfaction by segment
  - Cancellation insights (by driver & customer)
- Built a **dynamic Power BI dashboard** with:
  - Custom slicers
  - Drill-down capability
  - Real-time metrics
  - Geo-location visualizations

## 🧠 Use of AI in Development

While the core logic and dashboard design were created manually, I actively used **AI (ChatGPT)** to enhance productivity, accuracy, and learning:

- 📌 **SQL Query Assistance**: Resolved syntax errors, optimized joins, and handled aggregation logic using AI guidance.
- 🧠 **DAX Formula Support**: Received AI-based suggestions for measures like average rating, ride distance segmentation, and status-based filters.
- ⚡ **Debugging**: Reduced time spent on fixing logic issues and quickly understood best practices in data modeling.
  
This AI support helped me focus more on **business logic and visualization** rather than syntax hurdles.

## 📊 Insights Derived

- **UPI** was the most used payment method, accounting for over **47%** of total bookings.
- **Prime Sedan** vehicles had the highest average customer rating (**4.3/5**) and the longest average ride distance.
- Over **20% of cancelled rides** were due to personal or car-related issues from the driver’s end.
- High-demand zones like Sitabuldi, Nagpur Railway Station, and Dhantoli emerged as booking hotspots.

## 💡 Business Impact

- Helped identify **operational inefficiencies** and **customer behavior trends**.
- Enabled **better ride allocation**, **driver deployment**, and **incentive planning**.
- The dashboard is ready for **weekly reporting** and can be scaled for city-wise comparisons.
